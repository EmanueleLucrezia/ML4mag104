# Machine Learning for mag104, Ivrea (To)


Last week, Sat 25/05/2019 in Ivrea (TO) Italy, my best friends Federico and Alexander opened a new shop for cool clothes. Wishing to contribute to his luck, I am gonna try to use this tool, IBM Watson Studio, and my knowledge, a master degree in Math at the university of Turin, to code (python), discuss (probability and statistics) my 3rd project in the analysis of real data (that I will try to collect by myself, with autorization for sure).

You shall come personally to the shop, and contribute to the sample size

and/or you could comment here and contribute to my training.

From analyzing a toy SIMULATED data set of costumer entrance in a shop we will see:

    1 an unsupervised learning technique for clustering costumer behavior
    2 a supervised learning technique for predict costumer expense
    3 a reinforcement learning network for deciding how long assistant should attend costumer
